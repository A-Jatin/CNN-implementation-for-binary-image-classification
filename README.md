# CNN-implementation-for-dogs-and-cat-classifier
This repository contains an ipython notebook which implements a Convolutional Neural Network to do a binary image classification. I used this to classify Cats vs Dogs and you can get the dataset from here https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data . (This model trains with thousands of input images so be patient.)
